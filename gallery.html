   1. Community or Junior College Two-year undergraduate degrees in the USA can prepare you for a specific career, or the coursework can be applied to completion of a 4-year Bachelor's degree.
   Degrees: Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)
   ​
   Transfer Process: As a student, you may apply to transfer to a four-year college or university. The four-year institution will review all credits to determine how many can be applied to the four year degree. Some community colleges have transfer agreements with in-state four-year institutions, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the four-year institution provides the remaining years of study.

   ​2. Four-year University
   Satisfies university and class requirements to achieve a bachelor’s degree in a specific course of study (major).
   Bachelor's Degrees in the USA:
   Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BS), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.), Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) or Bachelor of Philosophy (B.Phil.) Five-Year Professional Architecture programs offer the Bachelor of Architecture Degree (B.Arch.).

   1. Why do students choose a community college or junior college first?
   Almost every four-year university also has a two-year college nearby. A two-year college is often called a community college or a junior college. You may earn an Associate’s degree and/or earn transfer credits toward the completion of a bachelor’s degree at a four-year university.
   -Generally speaking, tuition costs at community or junior colleges are significantly more reasonable than at the four-year universities
   ​-Classes are typically smaller at the community or junior college.
   For many academic programs, you will initially take a similar core curriculum, or set of courses, during your first two years of college. This is the case whether you attend a two-year college first, or if you go directly to a four-year university.
   -The minimum required grade point average (GPA) and other admission requirements are lower at a community college than at most four-year universities. Community colleges sometimes have "open admission," meaning the only requirement for admission is graduation from secondary school.
   -Many states have pre-determined transfer plans, or articulation agreements, between their two-year and four-year institutions. At the community college, the academic advisors will recommend a course work plan, based on your academic program. These plans are designed not only to meet the college’s associate degree graduation requirements, but also to make sure that the maximum number of credits taken is transferable to the four-year university.
   -The GPA that is required by universities when considering a transfer applicant is very often lower than that of a freshman applicant. For those students with a lower GPA from secondary school, successful study at a community college allows them a second chance of being admitted to a university.

   2. What are the academic requirements for transfer to a four-year university?
   Academic requirements for a student’s successful transfer will vary with each four-year university. As a student, you would meet with academic advisors and target the transfer requirements of your four-year university of choice. If you have completed a pre-specified number of credits at a community college (usually 30 credit hours, or ten 3-credit classes) and achieved a minimum grade point average (usually between 2.0/4.0 and 2.5/4.0, depending on the four-year university’s requirements), you will be considered by the four-year university for admission as a transfer student. Official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended MUST be submitted when applying for admission to a university.
   ​
   3. What transfer plans are available?
   The transfer arrangements between institutions vary. There are state-wide agreements that provide specific courses of study and simplify the university transfer process. There are also specific agreements arranged between institutions in the same community or area of academic expertise. You must work closely with the community college academic advisors to insure that you complete those courses that will result in the greatest number of transferable credits.

   As an international student coming to the United States, there are three different student visas that you could be issued: F1 Visa, J1 Visa or M1 Visa. The F1 and J1 visas allow for the possibility of employment in the US during your stay, while the M1 Visa does not. You need to be familiar with the types of visas, how they impact your financing while in the USA and how to go through the application and arrival processes.
   1. F1 Visa:
   -The "F" visa is for academic studies.
   -An F1 visa is issued to students who are attending an academic program or English Language Program.
   -F1 visas are by far the most common form of international student visa in the U.S.
   -F1 students must maintain the minimum course load for full-time student status. F-1 status allows for part-time, on-campus employment (fewer than 20 hours per week). Additionally, students can work on optional practical training (OPT) for up to one year after completion of their academic program.
   -Students are expected to complete their studies by the expiration date on the I-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status).
   2. J1 Visa:
   -A J1 visa is issued to students who need to obtain practical training that is not available in their home country to complete their academic program. J-1 student status allows for similar employment as the F-1 visa, with similar restrictions.
   3. M1 Visa:
   -An M1 visa is issued to a student who is going to attend a non-academic or vocational school. M-1 visa holders for technical and vocational programs are not permitted to work during the course of their studies. The M-1 student visa applicants must have evidence that sufficient funds are immediately available to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of intended stay.

   -As you begin to think about funding sources for your educational and living expenses in the United States, remember that you cannot count on working in the United States unless you have been granted a teaching or research assistantship. Immigration regulations are very strict with respect to working while carrying a student visa, and when you submit evidence of your financial resources, you cannot rely on potential income. The income on which you base your application must be assured, and it must be equal to or exceed the costs of the first year of your studies.

   -Careful long-term and short-term planning is necessary to ensure that you will have a rewarding educational experience in the United States. If you are realistic about your financial needs, you will be better able to enjoy the exciting academic and cultural experience of living and learning in the United States.

     -When putting together your application for a student visa, you will first need to research the admission policy for your university. Keep the following items in mind:
     ​1. ​Academic Eligibility
     -Every school has different academic eligibility criteria. Your school will tell you what their requirements are. If you are still in the process of researching different schools, you can use the USA School Search to research general academic standing and test scores.

     2. Financial Stability
     -You will need to show that you can support yourself without having to work.
     ​
     3. Health Insurance
     -You may have to show proof of health insurance in order to cover any medical expenses should you need any medical assistance.
